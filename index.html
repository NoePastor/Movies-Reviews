					<h2>Spider-man Across the spider-verse</h2>
					<h3>9/10</h3>
					<p>Spider-man across the spider-verse is, in my opinion, one of the best animated films ever made, and the best film of 2023. Whether it's the quality of the animation, the script or the tone and pace of the film, everything is perfect in my eyes. On my first viewing, I went through every emotion before arriving at the ending, which left me speechless! If you haven't already, go and see this film !!! </p>

					<h2>Batman the dark knight</h2>
					<h3>9/10</h3>
					<p>The Dark Knight is the best Batman movie ever, and arguably one of the best superhero movies ever. With Cristopher Nolan at the direction, it's impossible not to produce a masterpiece. The film's greatest strength, in addition to its excellent direction and screenplay, is Joker, the film's antagonist. I'm not afraid to say he's one of cinema's best villains.</p>

					<h2>Pulp Fiction</h2>
					<h3>8/10</h3>
					<p>It's impossible to talk about Quentin Tarantino without mentioning Pulp Fiction. When I saw this film, I felt as if I'd been transported out of time, following the film's atypical rhythm. In my opinion, this is the film's greatest strength, although the actors also play an important role.</p>

					<h2>Star Wars III</h2>
					<h3>8.5/10</h3>
					<p>Revenge of the Siths is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars film ever made. More than just a film, it's the conclusion of an arc, a trilogy, a prophecy. The development of Anakin is simply exceptional, the battle scenes are among the best in the saga, and the emotion felt before this film is incomparable when you're a Star Wars fan.</p>

					<h2>Weathering with you</h2>
					<h3>8/10</h3>
					<p>Weathering with you is my favorite Japanese animated film. The director of the world-famous "Your Name" has done it again, and in my opinion has done it better than his previous film. The landscapes, the music and the questions it raises make this film an exceptional work. It's not the kind of film I generally like, but this one is out of this world. I can only advise you to go and see it, because I'm pretty sure you haven't seen it yet.</p>

					<h2>Logan</h2>
					<h3>8,5/10</h3>
					<p>Logan is a tribute to Wolverine and to comic book fans. A true conclusion to the Fox saga, it showcases his beloved protagonist one last time, but this time in a much darker, much more violent and much more appocalyptic setting. It's impossible to describe the sadness and rage conveyed by this film, as much by the cruelty and violence of its scenes as by the beauty of the script and the performance of the actors. </p>
